# BioStats Weight Loss Analysis

Will patients who get treatment lose more weight over time than patients who do not get treatment ?

# t-Test Results

t-Test was performed to determine if there is a statistical difference in patients who received treatment and those who did not. t-Tets results gave a p-value of 2.2e-16 well below the 0.05 threshold essentially confirming the original assumption that patients who were treated were more likely to lose more weight than patients who were not treated.
